## Overview
Currently, a pain point for Javascript frontend development is the need to find cohesive colors and their RGB codes. Personally, I require a lot of time to test different colors and alter the RGB values so that the components on a page all look unified. 

This library will automatically generate RGB colors codes based on a user-inputted theme, so that developers no longer need to spend time choosing the correct colors for their components.
